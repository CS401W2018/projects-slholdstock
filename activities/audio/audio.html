        <h2>What are the positives and negatives of hosting your videos on YouTube?</h2>
        <p>A positive is that you can have youtube host your videos for free. A downside is that at the end of the video it pops up recommended videos that can lead to other things you don't want it to.</p>
        <h2>What is the most useful thing you can do with a transform?</h2>
        <p>Rotating images is the most useful thing we will use it for. Translating it is also a possibility.</p>
        <h2>How do you stay safe online?</h2>
        <p>We did not talk about this in class, but I looked it up and it talked a lot about using a secure browser, so checking to see if the browser is https://. It also talked about using a vpn on public networks to better protect your personal data.</p>
        <h2>What is the schedule for the rest of the class?</h2>
        <p>Next week we will have a prectice exam on monoday and a real final exam on wendesday. The friday after thanksgiving we will not have class and then the structure will be the same for the week after thanksgiving as well. We will not have projects outside of the final project that we will be working on. We will also have checkups between now and the due date to make sure that we are working on our final projecct and not waiting until the last minute.</p>
