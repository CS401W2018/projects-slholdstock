        <h2 class="green">List out the different ways to select an item.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>tag name</li>
            <li>descendent</li>
            <li>ID (#) usually noun</li>
            <li>Class (.) usually adjective</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="first">What is the difference between an ID and a Class?</h2>
        <p>The main difference is that this will work, but an HTML validator will invalidate it. An ID can only be used once while a class can be repeated. A tag can also have more than one tag while the ID can only have one.</p>
        <div class="dark">
            <h2 class="green bigger">What is the difference between the SPAN and DIV tag</h2>
            <p>SPAN tags allow you to select a <span class="yellow bold">certain part of something like a paragraph</span> to then change the appearance with CSS. A DIV tag allows you to add multiple tags. It also causes line breaks. It almost creates a box or block on the page.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="light">
        <h2>What is the difference between a DIV tag and HEADER, MAIN, and FOOTER?</h2>
        <p>DIV used to be used like header, main, and footer are used now. When the guys got together and decided how HTML would be universally, they realized that people were constantly using DIV tags to do the same things, so now they have their own dedicated tags for their respective purpose.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>What are different ways to select a color?</h2>
        <p>One way is select the colored box that pops up next to the predefined colors to manually select a color with rgb values. At least you can in Visual Studio Code.</p>
