    <p><strong>What is the best way to make sure you get a good grade on the projects?</strong></p>
    <p>Make sure that we answer the questions and have evidence of us following along in the class. Make sure the HTML is done just as it is asking us to do. We are graded on the tags, not the appearance of the page.</p>
    <p><strong> When is your project due?</strong></p>
    <p>Our next project will be due on monday at midnight, and they will typically be due mondays at midnight from here on out.</p>
    <p><strong>What are <mark>special entity</mark> characters?</strong></p>
    <p>Special entity characters have different code so that they will show up on your page. They always start with "&" and end with ";" <br> For example:</p>
    <p>&gt; is written using the "code" & + gt + ; while &lt; is written using the "code" & + lt + ;</p>
    <p>&copy; is written using the "code" & + "copy" + ;</p>
    <p><strong>What is the difference between <em>OL</em> and <em>UL</em> tags?</strong></p>
    <p>The OL tag will create an <em>Ordered List</em> while the UL tag creates an <em>Unordered List.</em></p>
