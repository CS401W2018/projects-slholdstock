        <h2>What did you learn about Flex and CSS?</h2>
        <p>The kids get to determine their size, and the parents will then take up the space that is left. It is much easier to use especially when making a page that is used on mobile devices too by using the wrap feature.</p>
        <h2>Why do you need to have an accessible website?</h2>
        <p>Our websites need to be used by all. Some people can't see or read like everyone and need to use screen readers. Our webpages must support this type of access for those certain people. We also need to take colorblind people into account, or people that have difficulty using a computer mouse.</p>
