        <h2>The form tag has an "action" attribute. What does it do?</h2>
        <p>The action tag acts as a tag that allows you to make your form tag send you to another website. Specifies where to send it to.</p>
        <h2>The form tag has a "method" attribute. What does it do?</h2>
        <p>Part of the HTTP protocol. Get tells it that it wants to read a page off of their server. Specifies the method of sending the form of data.</p>
        <h2>What is the difference between a "POST" and a "GET"?</h2>
        <p>The difference is that it won't show up in the URL of the browser. One is no more secure than the other. A get request is saying that you want to read something. Anytime you click on a link, it's a get request. A Post request means that you want to add or change information on the server. Logging in to a website is an example because you are changing from being not logged in to being logged in. Almost always you'll want to use a post request.</p>
