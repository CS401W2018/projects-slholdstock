        <h2>How much time should you spend on an engagement assignment after class?</h2>
        <p>Ideally we shouldn't need to spend more than 20-30 minutes outside of class to respond to the questions. If we are doing it for extra practice, we can do it for longer if we want.</p>
        <h2>What should you focus on?</h2>
        <p>We should focus on practicing and following along with what Bro. Slade shows us in class. The questions exist to help us to make sure that we understand the concepts behind what he is showing us.</p>
        <h2>what is the main difference between <em>CSS Grid</em> and <em>CSS Flex?</em></h2>
        <p>CSS Grid is used to place things two-dimensionally while CSS Flex is either rows or columns making it one-dimensional. CSS Grid also determines the size and space of a component acting like a strict parent. CSS Flex allows the component to decide their own sizes and the and the "parent" has to fit in with what is left.</p>
