    <h2>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</h2>
    <p>Absolute links always contain the entire domain name. These also link to outside websites. Relative links are links to your website only. If you have to change the domain name, the relative links will automatically move with it.</p>
