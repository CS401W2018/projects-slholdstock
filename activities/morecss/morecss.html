            <h2>What is the difference between block tags and inline tags?</h2>
            <p>Block tags are most of the tags that we use. Image tags, anchor tags, and strong and emphasize and other tags like that are inline tags because they affect the liine itself. The block tags take up a space that looks like a block.</p>
            <h2>What is the margin, border, and padding?</h2>
            <p>The margin is the space outside of the box. We can control it separately in css to change the margin. By default, h1 tags and paragraph tags have a margin. Padding is on the inside of the box. For example if you have a box and want to shift where the text is within the box. Border tags can be used with the figure tag to put a visible border around something.</p>
            <h2>What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?</h2>
            <p>We use pixels because the computer understands it very easily. We can also use millimeters, centimeters, or even relative measurements like percentages.</p>
            <h2>When woud you use a figure tag?</h2>
            <p>We use a figure tag when we want to place a picture and a caption together. It changes it so that it has a sort of built in visible border.</p>
