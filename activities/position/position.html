        <h2>What is the difference between a block and an inline tag? Give examples of each one.</h2>
        <p>A block tag is something that makes an actual box on your webpage. You can add a border, a background color, or other things like that. An example would be the header tag, the main tag, or the border tag. An inline tag is something that cannot be given a height or a width. An example would be the anchor tags or image tags.</p>
        <h2>What is normal flow in HTML?</h2>
        <p>Normal flow is the default positioning of your HTML on your page. It says that a block tag demands the entire width of the page even if the contents don't.</p>
        <h2>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h2>
        <p>The float helps with positioning certain elements in your HTML. For example with a picture, it will put the image where we want it, then all the text "floats" around the rest of the unused space</p>
        <h2>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h2>
        <p>Absolute is as if you took something (like an image) out of the page so that you could place it wherever you want. Relative is as if you take the image and place it relative to other things around it and it takes up the whole space. The fixed fixes an image to the edge of the browser page so it doesn't move as you scroll.</p>
        <h2>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h2>
        <p>You can add background colors to the links and add a nav a:hover css property where you change or alternate the colors when the mouse is hovering over it.</p>
        <h2>Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</h2>
        <p>You can find them in canvas at the top of the week section that is always titled with "Lecture Notes." For this weeks videos you just need to click on the one titled "Lecture Notes - CSS and Box Model."</p>
