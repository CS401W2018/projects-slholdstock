            <h2>How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</h2>
            <p>If you can't find a picture that is the size you need it to be, you can look up way to resize your image according to the device you are using. You can also use websites to help resize images. Photoshop is also used to resize images.</p>
            <h2>Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS?</h2>
            <p>It is not recommended because we don't want to save a huge picture and use the height and the width to change the size of the picture. It's best to download a picture as close to what you want as possible, then you can make minor adjustments with CSS.</p>
