            <h2>What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?</h2>
            <p>JPEG photos are good to use because of their compression while maintaining a certain quality in the photo.</p>
            <h2>What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?</h2>
            <p>GIF photos are good to use because of their limited color depth and because they also allow the pictures to be animated. That makes it helpful for logos or icons as well as illustrations.</p>
            <h2>What is unique about the PNG format?</h2>
            <p>PNG is unique because it uses lossless compression. That means that when you compress your image, it still maintains all of the original data and its quality. It keeps the details and information such as creation date and copyright information.</p>
            <h2>How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</h2>
            <p>If you can't find a picture that is the size you need it to be, you can look up way to resize your image according to the device you are using. You can also use websites to help resize images. Photoshop is also used to resize images.</p>
            <h2>Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS?</h2>
            <p>It is not recommended because we don't want to save a huge picture and use the height and the width to change the size of the picture. It's best to download a picture as close to what you want as possible, then you can make minor adjustments with CSS.</p>
