                        <h2 class="title">Argentina</h2>
                        <p>Argentina has a rich culinary history that dates back to before the 16th century. Since then, they have gone forth adding to their cuisine through the indigenous, European, Spanish, and African influences that were brought over the years. They adopted additional cooking methods from Argentina's native people -- the Guaraní, Quechua, and Mapuche.</p>
                        <p>Today, Argentina is best known for their beef which they prepare as an <strong>asado</strong> which means barbecue. Argentina is considered to have the highest quality beef in the entire world. They pair their delicious meats with a mouth-watering chimichurri sauce which is a blend of fresh herbs and oil with a tangy acid to balance the flavors. Their cuisine is so much more than just meat though. They also specialize in empanadas that are like pastries that are stuffed with meat, vegetables, and cheese.</p>

                    <p>Their world renowned asado dates back centuries ago when the first Spanish colonists brought cows to Argentina. As ovens and the other common cooking methods that we have today were not invented yet at the time, the gauchos, Argentine cowboys, would prepare the beef that they had only seasoned with salt over an open flame. They would invite all of their family and friends to share the wonderful meal. Today it is a common sight to see many families gathered together in the streets or in someone's yard with a parrilla, cooking up their favorite beef.</p>
                    <p>While the asado is the national dish of Argentina, it is not all that it has to offer. Argentina is made up of five regions with distinct cuisines. In the Northern and Northeastern region, you will find that they cook a lot stews as well as use a lot of meat, potato, corn, and yuca. Many of their techniques come from indigenous methods. In the Northern region a popular dish is the <strong>tamale</strong>. This is corn dough filled with meats and potato. In the Northeastern region, a popular dish to find is a type of bread made from corn flour, cheese, and fennel known as <strong>chipas</strong>.</p>

                        <p>In the Cuyo, Pampas, and Patagonian regions of Argentina, you can find a strong Spanish and European influence. They eat a lot of beef, goat, potato, onion, cheeses, creams, and even some fish. In the Cuyo region, which is located on the west side, they eat <strong>humitas en chalas</strong> which is a corn-based filling mixed with cheese and onions, then wrapped in corn husks. It is similar to the tamale, but it has no filling. In the Pampas, found in the center, they eat a dish called <strong>milanesa</strong>. This is a piece of beef that has been flattened, breaded, and fried and is served with a salad or mashed potatoes. It can also be made with other meats like chicken. Lastly, in the Patagonian region, named this way because of its location near the Patagonia mountain range, they have a wide variety of dishes that they enjoy. One of the most peculiar is the <strong>Patagonian lamb</strong>. This is a lamb that has been skinned and gutted, but then it is tied up to a type of cross to roast for hours near an open flame. The cooking process takes around four to six hours, and the smell of it fills the streets where it is being cooked. It is served with potatoes and topped with chimichurri.</p>
