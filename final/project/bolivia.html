                        <h2 class="title">Bolivia</h2>
                        <p>Bolivia's cuisine goes back to before the 16th century when the Aymara and Inca, two indigenous groups, were using their crops of potato, corn, and quinoa in many different ways. As others started to come to Bolivia, hoping to make it their home, thier cuisine started to mix with the Spanish, German, Italian, and French influence that the people brought.</p>
                        <p>Bolivia has three distinct regions, and each region has their own type of food. The three regions are the high plains, where people eat a lot of potatoes, corn, llama, soups, and bread; the foothills, where they eat a lot of soup, beef, chicken, yuca, noodles, and rice; and the tropical lowlands, where they eat a lot of yuca, tropical fruits, sausages, and rice.</p>
                        <p>Bolivia is unique in that is it a biodiversity hotspot. Each of the regions mentioned above  allows the country to produce a large variety of ingreidents that they in turn use in all types of dishes. This has helped the country to define food as part of its cultural heritage. For every celebration, whether it is a birthday for a baby or the country's independence day, you can witness the people sharing with all of those around them because for them, food exists to celebrate and share.</p>

                    <p>Like much of the rest of South America, Bolivia has a small breakfast of bread and some hot drink like a tea or coffee. The lunch is the big meal where everyone comes home from work and the whole family is gathered to spend some time together. This is when they start with a bowl of soup like the <strong>sopa de maní</strong> before passing on to the main course which is often a plate piled full of rice or noodles, with meat, vegetables, and you can almost always count on a potato or corn. The dinner comes later in the day around 8 or 9 o'clock where they will have another small meal that is usually a small sandwich or an empanada.</p>
                    <p>Bolivia is home to many national dishes. Perhaps the most recognized around the country is the <strong>salteña</strong> that is like an empanada, but a major difference is that there is liquid inside along with the meat and vegetables. Another national dish is the <strong>Pique a lo Macho</strong>. This dish is a bed of fries with meats and vegetables piled on top. You can find a recipe for Pique <a href="https://www.cocina-boliviana.com/recetas/plato-principal/pique-macho">here</a>!</p>
