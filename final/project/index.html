                        <p>Latin America is home to some of the most flavorful dishes and cuisines in the world. They pride themselves in their unique and vibrant flavors that reflects the diversity of each country's region. They love to use fresh, locally grown ingredients in all of their favorite dishes that have been passed down from generation to generation. Each country uses their speical dishes as a means to celebrate their culture and their history in each and every bite. In Latin American culture, food is so much more than just some ingredients thrown on a plate. It is a representation of  hard work and considered the best way to strengthen bonds and relationships with the most important people in their lives.</p>

                            <p>Food can be seen as a way to bring people together in all parts of the world, but the way that it does it in Latin America is unmatched. In the world there are many different economic classes and ways to see one person as better than another, but in Latin America, the food crosses the boundaries of those differences and makes everyone equal.</p>
