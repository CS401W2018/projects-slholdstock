                        <h2 class="title">Mexico</h2>
                        <p>A lot of times when people think about food from Latin America, the first country that comes to mind for them is Mexico. Mexican food has become very popular, but it is so much more than just tacos and burritos. It started with the Aztecs, Mayans, and Purepecha indigenous groups. Then, as the europeans, mostly the Spanish, came to colonize Spain, they brought their own techniques and ingredients with them. Some new methods were also introduced to the indigenous like baking and even frying which today are staples to the Mexican cuisine.</p>
                        <p>Mexico is broken up into seven geographical regions, and each has their own twist on the igredients used and dishes that are native to them. The regions are the North, North Pacific Coast, Bajio, South Pacific Coast, South, Gulf, Central. A more in depth break down of each region can be found <a href="https://sazonexperience.com/seven-culinary-regions-of-mexico/">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>In the Northern region of Mexico it is easy to see the indigenous methods mix with the Spanish methods of cooking. There are many ranchers found in this part of Mexico, and as a result, they eat a lot of meat like beef, goat, and pork. They combine that with cheeses and tortillas to make some delicious dishes. One of the most popular is the <strong>machaca</strong> which is dried and shredded meat that is mixed with vegetables like peppers and chiles or eggs and served with a tortilla. Next to it is the North Pacific Coast region. This region uses indigenous methods of using corn and chiles and have combined it with the Spanish use of pork and seafood. A very popular dish from this region is the <strong>pozole rojo</strong> which is a type of stew made from corn, pork, and red chili broth.</p>

                        <p>The Bajio region boasts a strong Spanish influence. They enjoy many kinds of dishes with pork, corn, and beans as the base. One of the most popular in the region is the <strong>carnitas</strong>. This is pork that has been brasied and roasted that can be eaten as is, or as a filling for tacos and burritos. While it came from this region, it can be found in many others.</p>
                        <p>In the South Pacific Coast region, one will find Indigenous influence along with African influence that was brought over by the Spanish. They cook with a lof of corn, chile, and chocolate. When they mix these ingredients together, they make a deliicous dish called <strong>mole negro</strong> which is particularly popular in Oaxaca. This dish is type of sauce that is served over chicken or enchiladas. It is also the national dish of Mexico!</p>
                        <p>The Southern region of Mexico has somewhat of a similar history to it.The major difference being that instead of the African influence, we see some carribean influence creep its way into the way the foods are prepared and the ingredients used. This is made apparent in their use of tropcial fruits that go along with the corn and honey that are already used. They make a dish called <strong>sope de lima</strong> which is a citrus soup that is sometimes werved with rice.</p>

                    <p>The Gulf region is found right on, you guessed it, the Gulf of Mexico. Here they have access to plenty of seafood. The Europeans that traveled to Mexico brought many of their spices over and use them a lot today along with the rice and other ingredients that were already there. They also have quite a strong carribean influence. One of their popular dishes is the <strong>Veracruz-style red snapper</strong>. This is a fish dish smothered in a salsa and served with olives. The Central regions differs a lot from this. They use primarliy their indigenous ways mixed with some of the Spanish methods that were brought over. They cook with a lot of meats and tortillas, but one of their most popular dishes is called the <strong>torta</strong>. This is a sandwich filled with a variety of assortments. Some include avocado, beans, lettuce, salsa, and meats.</p>
