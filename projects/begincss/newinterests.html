        <h2 class="bold">An Inspiration</h2>
        <p>For more than a century, soccer has been recognized by the world as the most popular sport. It attracts billions of views per year as well as billions of dollars for the teams and investors. Around the world, kids start playing at around the age of 2 and start training to try and become the best player of all time. It is a debate about who the best player of all time really is, but I have come to be a big fan of the Portugese star Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
        <p>I have always tried to model my own game to be like how Ronaldo plays. He has an explosive step and incredible control with the ball at his foot. It also seems that he has a rocket for a foot when he shoots the ball to score all of his goals. The more I played and tried to emulate him, I got better and better and was able to have many opportunities to represent my state across the country. Ronaldo was always an inspiration to me that pushed me to keep trying my hardest.</p>

        <ul>
            <li class="em">I used this brighter blue color to emphasize things.</li>
            <li class="foot">I used this lighter brown color to de-emphasize things.</li>
            <li>I chose the lighter brown color because it was a nice color and easier on the eyes. I chose the different blues for the text because they contrasted well with the background, and they are also similar to the colors of jersey that Ronaldo wore at his different teams.</li>
