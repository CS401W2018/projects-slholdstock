                    <p>Mary and Brian met in a floral shop more than 25 years ago. Their relationship took off and they have since given birth to 4 kids. They raised them with great values and taught them to work hard and always be goal driven. They often taught about the Savior and how to always have a great relationship with Him. They are almost empty nesters and are trying to figure out what they are going to do with all of this new time that they will have on their hands.</p>

                    <h2>Siblings</h2>
                    <p>We are 4 siblings. The oldest is dressed as the Tin Man and his name is Clayton. He is 26 years old and works in the operations department at Goldman Sachs. Next comes Mitchell who is dressed as the scarecrow. He is 23 years old and a full-time student at Southern Utah University where he is studying computer science. Samuel comes in third dressed as the Cowardly Lion. He is 21 years old and currently studying at BYU-Hawaii where he is double majoring in Computer Science and Political Science. Abby is the youngest of the family and dressed as Dorothy. She just graduated high school and has started hair school to become a hair stylist.</p>

                    <h2>Binx</h2>
                    <p>Binx is our family dog. It is quite odd that we have a dog considering Samuel and Mitchell are both allergic to them. Despite this, during the Covid pandemic, we were in need of some excitement and entertainment and we adopted a golden doodle. He has become an important member of the family and always keeps things interesting and us entertained. Look at him, he is just so cute!</p>
