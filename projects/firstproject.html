<h2> Internet</h2>
<p> The internet is a network of computers that connects with other computers around the world to share information.</p>
<h2> Web</h2>
<p>The web is a system of websites accessbile through the internet.</p>
<h2> How are the Internet and Web different?</h2>
<p> The internet is the network that connects everyone from wherever they are, and the web uses the internet to access information that is shared, like a website or emails. </p>
<h2> ASCII and Unicode</h2>
<p> Both ASCII and Unicode are character encoders meaning they have an assigned number value assigned to each character so that the computer can understand it because computers don't understand letters and words like we do. ASCII is not as universal as Unicode because Unicode supports various languages. </p>
<h2> What is UTF-8?</h2>
<p> UTF-8 or Unicode Transformation Format - 8 bits, is an encoding system for Unicode. What it does is transform a character from Unicode to a binary string and vice versa. It is useful because it saves memory.</p>
<h2> URL</h2>
<p>  URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, is an address that one uses to gain access to certain resources on the internet.</p>
<h2> Domain Name</h2>
<p> The domain name is the part of your URL that is like the main part that the computer usnderstands as an IP address to show you what you are searching for. For example: www.byuh.edu</p>
<h2> HTTP </h2>
<p> HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol which is used by the web to transmit information for certain things like pictures and videos.</p>
<h2> HTTPS </h2>
<p> HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Seccure and is essentially the same as HTTP, but with more security. The data is encrypted so that it is harder to tamper with. </p>
<h2> IP Address </h2>
<p> An IP Address or Internet Protocol Address is a set of numbers that uses 32 or 128 bits that is assigned to a device on the internet. The device then becomes recognizable by the internet so that it can communicate with other devices. </p>
<h2> DNS </h2>
<p> DNS stands for Domain Name System is what translates a domain name into an IP Address that the computer can use to connect with others. If you type a domain name like www.byuh.edu, DNS will turn it into the IP Address that the computer understands. </p>
<h2> W3C Recommendations</h2>
<p> W3C Recommendations are a set of web standards that have been designed to optimize accessiblity and ensure quality.</p>
<h2> XML, XHTML, HTML, HTML5</h2>
<p> XML is eXtensible Markup Language which is a language that makes it so that both humans and computers can understand something using tags that the user defines. 
    XHTML is  eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language which is a type of HTML and XML crossbreed. It exists to have more reliable web documents that work well with other formats.
    HTML is Hypertext Markup Language is a standard for documents and pages designed for the web. 
    HTML5 is the latest version of HTML that has been improved over the years.</p>
