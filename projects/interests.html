        <h2>An Inspiration</h2>
        <p>For more than a century, soccer has been recognized by the world as the most popular sport. It attracts billions of views per year as well as billions of dollars for the teams and investors. Around the world, kids start playing at around the age of 2 and start training to try and become the best player of all time. It is a debate about who the best player of all time really is, but I have come to be a big fan of the Portugese star Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
        <p>I have always tried to model my own game to be like how Ronaldo plays. He has an explosive step and incredible control with the ball at his foot. It also seems that he has a rocket for a foot when he shoots the ball to score all of his goals. The more I played and tried to emulate him, I got better and better and was able to have many opportunities to represent my state across the country. Ronaldo was always an inspiration to me that pushed me to keep trying my hardest.</p>
