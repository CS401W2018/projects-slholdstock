        <p class="space">This is a tour of some of the largest and prettiest soccer stadiums located in Spain. <br>Soccer has been played since the late 1800's when British miners introduced the sport. <br> From then, the sport has taken off in popularity and finds itself deeply rooted in the country's culture. <br> It was once played on dirt fields and in the streets, but now people travel from all over<br> to these luxurious stadiums to watch the sport that they love.</p>
