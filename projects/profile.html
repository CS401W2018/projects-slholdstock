    <h1>Who is Samuel Holdstock?</h1>
    <p>I am from Utah and have lived there my whole life. I was born into a family of two older brothers, then years after me, a younger sister was added. We moved around Utah for a while before settling down for my dad's job as a nurse practitioner. During this time, I found comfort and familiarity by playing soccer daily. It came to be a huge part of my life for many years. I would race home to get my homework done after school so that I could go and practice at the soccer field across the street.</p>
    <p>As I got older, I realized that I had become quite good at soccer. I outgrew the team I played for in the little town I lived in. With the support of my parents, I started trying out for better teams farther away from my house. It proved successful and after a few years I found myself on the best soccer team in the state of Utah, and in the top 3 nationally ranked soccer teams. I will always carry the memories made and the lessons learned on the soccer field as I continue to traverse this life with new heights and goals in mind.</p>
    <h2>Order of soccer teams I played for:</h2>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>Elite FC</li>
        <li>Utah Soccer Alliance</li>
        <li>Copper Mountain</li>
        <li>Utah Storm</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This is a quote that I used to motivate me to <strong>practice harder</strong> everyday.</p>
