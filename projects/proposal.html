        <h1>My Final Project Proposal</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>The title and topic of your site.</h2>
        <p>The title of my page will be Bolivian Cuisine and that wil be the topic as well. It will be a webpage about the history or cuisine in Bolivia and specific dishes and techniques that they use to prepare food that are unique to them.</p>
        <h2>A brief paragraph about why you choose this topic.</h2>
        <p>I am choosing this topic because I served my mission in Bolivia and got back almost a year ago. I love Bolivia with all my heart and miss the people and the food there. I want to make this website so that I can compile recipes and techniques from the country so that people can try out Bolivian food in their own home.</p>
        <h2>List out the content you will have on the home page and each of the five pages (one will have a table).</h2>
        <p>The home page will contain images of food and bolivians themselves preparing food. It will give a brief rundown of what is unique to them. From there, one page will be about why food is important to the culture. One will be about the ancient cooking techniques used. One will be about a popular treat called the salteña which will contain a table showing their nutrition facts. One will be about different regions of food within the country and how they vary (the altiplano and the lowlands). The last page will be about drinks from bolivia.</p>
        <h2>What fields (or information you will collect) will you put into your form? What data will go on your table?</h2>
        <p>For the fields in my form I will have a place to sign up for a type of email subscription for people to get recipes sent to their emails monthly. I'll have the first name (text field), last name(text field), email (email field), checkbox (checkbox field)) to agree to the "terms", select how often you want to get emails (weekly, every two weeks, monthly in a select field). The data in the table will be nutrition facts for the salteña.</p>
        <h2>How will you collect information/images/content for your site? You need at least 5 references on your site, list out at least 2 of references you plan on using.</h2>
        <p>I will ask some of my bolivian friends that live there for their help. One specifically is named Cinthia Fuentes. For images I will use google images under the creative commons license search to find wikipedia images or use images I took myself. I will also use <a href="https://www.visitbolivia.net/bolivia-guide/bolivian-food.html">this</a> website. I will also share my own experiences with the food.</p>
        <h2>Include a statement acknowledging that you have read the warnings below.</h2>
        <p>I have read and agree to the warnings stated.</p>
