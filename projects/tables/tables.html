                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>I am an avid runner and I have been training for a long time to complete a marathon. To help me with my training I have been tracking my running to see which areas I can improve in. I run early in the morning every single day, and Saturdays are my long runs. Sundays I take my rest day.</p>
                <p>Preparing for this marathon has been both challenging and rewarding. I have been able to show my determination and it has been good to see the process of making goals and trying my hardest to achieve them.</p>
                <p>Something that I have done, apart from the running itself, is pay attention to my nutrition. It has been important for me to eat plenty of calories to replenish those that are depleted while running, but making sure that they are relatively healthy calories. I am confident that all of these will help me to finish my marathon.</p>
